	pair_challenge	24.85		1.0	yes	yes	10.0	10.0	9.0	4.0	2.0	No - the law 'bar' test example is fairly dependent on one's knowledge of the English language and/or law school technicalities. Meanwhile, the Image-Captcha - while tedious - is more accessible to users who speak different languages, as they can look up the prompt of an Image-Captcha in their mother language and identify the images accordingly (in retrospect, I realized that this is also technically true for a written Captcha challenge).	Honestly, I would include more questions in the challenge, perhaps even doubling the count to 10 (I think there were 5 prompts). As it is, the randomly generated pairwise examples gave me 4 comparisons where both 'bar' terms referred to a bar where you get drinks and only one comparison was comparing drastically different examples. With a larger pool of questions, this would allow for some more diverse comparisons for each participant.	True	bar
