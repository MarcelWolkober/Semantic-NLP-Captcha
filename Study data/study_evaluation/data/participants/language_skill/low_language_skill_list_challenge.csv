	list_challenge	204.54	0.74		yes	no	7.0	9.0	3.0	3.0	1.0	It depends on the language. If the semantic captcha is not in my native language, I would prefer the image captcha. If the sentence is in my native language, I would have no preference (maybe the time it takes me to solve the corresponding captcha).	It wasn't really possible to order the sentences that didn't have a similar meaning (I'm not sure if this was intentional).	False	part

	list_challenge	93.27	1.0		yes	no	5.0	10.0	9.0	3.0	5.0	No	The manual ordering interface is annoying. Please consider developing alternative input methods	True	arm			
	list_challenge	181.22	1.0		no	no	5.0	7.0	4.0	3.0	5.0	No, because I think it's rather difficult because there is always room for interpretation with sentences		True	bank

	list_challenge	150.85	0.03		yes	no	7.0	3.0	4.0	8.0	3.0	No, because I could understand image captchas and solve them much faster than the proposed Semantic NLP catches. Because we humans see faster than we read. Compared to the typical scenarios in image captchas, which are rather trivial, like spotting the traffic light, I found the topic here quite abstract, making ordering difficult. Maybe only selecting matching sentences so the given reference sentence.		False	part

	list_challenge	97.99	-0.87		yes	no	7.0	4.0	3.0	1.0	1.0	No, images are still easier to get the gist of it and they are faster to solve as the visual apparatus functions faster then the reading one	:D	False	record
