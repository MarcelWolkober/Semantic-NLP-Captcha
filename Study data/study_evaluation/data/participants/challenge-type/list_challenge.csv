I think the idea is fun, but the idea of testing if one's a human by testing one's semantic understanding in English is something I find quite problematic. It assumes that every user would be proficient enough to answer the test seeing as it requires near-native proficiency to understand the examples, which is not the case for a lot of people, and particularly disparaging towards non-native speakers coming from a minority background. It is also implied that there is (only) one correct answer to this test, which is never really the case when it comes to  semantics, as people might have different conceptualisations of meaning based on their previous knowledge and how knowledge is mapped and linked in the brain.

I suppose you could set a task like 'find all the sentences where the meaning of word X is the same as in the example sentence'. That could work. I don't think a ranking exercise would work though.	I think this is a really nice idea - more interesting than finding all the photos with a car in them (well, more interesting for me as a linguist, at least). On the other hand, there are some obvious problems with creating a captcha challenge of this sort in that not everyone always agrees about distinctions between senses of words (lumpers vs. splitters) and this would discriminate against non-speakers of English (or would one be able to select one's own L1 for this? Maybe not all languages are as easy to create a challenge of this sort as English is). Good luck with the study	True	bar

It may also be complicated for people without high education. Image-Captcha are more accessible.	It would be nice if people could choose what kind of Captcha they prefer, to avoid accessibility issues.	True	arm

	list_challenge	30.95	1.0		yes	no	8.0	9.0	7.0	5.0	8.0	I'd like it because it's something else for a change. But I'm rather steeped in linguistics, might be hard to understand for people who are not.		True	bank

	list_challenge	105.1	-0.61		yes	no	8.0	5.0	3.0	4.0	5.0	Probably not. I found the captcha challenged quite difficult. You need quite a fundamental understanding of the English language to know all semantic nuances of a word regarding it's context	Quite an interesting approach. However, it might not feasible to use as not every user is so fluid in the English language	False	twist

	list_challenge	45.14	0.74		yes	yes	10.0	9.0	7.0	4.0	4.0	Yes, because I'm a linguist :)	Good luck with your research!	False	part			
	list_challenge	52.38	1.0		yes	no	8.0	9.0	9.0	7.0	5.0	No, image is more convenient for me as you can easily spot patterns / objects and there is no need to read through sentences. Also images are more language-independent.	A short introduction on what a Captcha-challenge is would have been nice. But apart from this the study was great!	True	arm

	list_challenge	71.06	0.23		yes	yes	10.0	8.0	6.0	3.0	3.0	It's a nice change of pace, but I feel like it would be very easy to solve with an LLM – and if it's not currently, if it catches on, then someone will research until they can break it.		False	twist
