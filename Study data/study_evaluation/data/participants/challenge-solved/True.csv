Meanwhile, the Image-Captcha - while tedious - is more accessible to users who speak different languages, as they can look up the prompt of an Image-Captcha in their mother language and identify the images accordingly (in retrospect, I realized that this is also technically true for a written Captcha challenge).	Honestly, I would include more questions in the challenge, perhaps even doubling the count to 10 (I think there were 5 prompts). As it is, the randomly generated pairwise examples gave me 4 comparisons where both 'bar' terms referred to a bar where you get drinks and only one comparison was comparing drastically different examples. With a larger pool of questions, this would allow for some more diverse comparisons for each participant.	True	bar

I think the idea is fun, but the idea of testing if one's a human by testing one's semantic understanding in English is something I find quite problematic. It assumes that every user would be proficient enough to answer the test seeing as it requires near-native proficiency to understand the examples, which is not the case for a lot of people, and particularly disparaging towards non-native speakers coming from a minority background. It is also implied that there is (only) one correct answer to this test, which is never really the case when it comes to  semantics, as people might have different conceptualisations of meaning based on their previous knowledge and how knowledge is mapped and linked in the brain. It might be good to read up on cognitive linguistics/semantics for this study.	True	record

I suppose you could set a task like 'find all the sentences where the meaning of word X is the same as in the example sentence'. That could work. I don't think a ranking exercise would work though.	I think this is a really nice idea - more interesting than finding all the photos with a car in them (well, more interesting for me as a linguist, at least). On the other hand, there are some obvious problems with creating a captcha challenge of this sort in that not everyone always agrees about distinctions between senses of words (lumpers vs. splitters) and this would discriminate against non-speakers of English (or would one be able to select one's own L1 for this? Maybe not all languages are as easy to create a challenge of this sort as English is). Good luck with the study	True	bar
