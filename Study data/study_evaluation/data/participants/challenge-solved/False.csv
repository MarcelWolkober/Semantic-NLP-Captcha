Maybe I have overread it, but maybe emphasize in the instructions more that you are interested in the meaning of the words in bold-face and not the sentences in general. My ratings refer to a meaning comparison of the wohle sentence. I just understood to rate the bold-face words when I saw the question on the general information page.	False	bank
