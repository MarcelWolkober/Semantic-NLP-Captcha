	list_challenge	55.99	0.94		yes	no	9.0	9.0	5.0	5.0	0.0		"I like image captcha because it's a simple matter of clicking. This one is arguably harder for the human (and perhaps not even for the machine). The other ""issue"" is that in the example I had (""record"") there were clearly two different senses (thing to put music on; thing to keep track of other things) and ranking them doesn't really really make sense -- it's more of a ""put it in the correct box"" type of deal"	True	record

	list_challenge	74.56	0.81		yes	no	9.0	1.0	4.0	2.0	1.0	Not really. I think we are in a phase where Captchas are only being (mis)used for cheap data labeling.	Asking for an absolute ordering may be too much, when there are multiple sentences that are not related at all. This will probably introduce noise in your study.	True	record			
	list_challenge	98.55	1.0		yes	no	9.0	6.0	7.0	2.0	2.0	While it would be more fun and I personally might prefer it because of that, I think anyone who has less than near-native proficiency in English would not be able to complete the challenge and thus others might not prefer it.	I think the idea is fun, but the idea of testing if one's a human by testing one's semantic understanding in English is something I find quite problematic. It assumes that every user would be proficient enough to answer the test seeing as it requires near-native proficiency to understand the examples, which is not the case for a lot of people, and particularly disparaging towards non-native speakers coming from a minority background. It is also implied that there is (only) one correct answer to this test, which is never really the case when it comes to  semantics, as people might have different conceptualisations of meaning based on their previous knowledge and how knowledge is mapped and linked in the brain. It might be good to read up on cognitive linguistics/semantics for this study.	True	record			
	list_challenge	101.05	0.29		yes	no	9.0	7.0	3.0	3.0	5.0	Definitely not.	With 1-2 items, the context seemed very restricted (maybe too restricted to even judge the exact meaning of that instance). I would have liked to get more information on what exactly you were looking for in terms of similarity, assuming there's one ideal solution. Is 'record' inside a compound like 'record label' the same as a specific record, or less similar to playing a record than a specific record (if so, on what grounds)?	False	record			
	list_challenge	97.99	-0.87		yes	no	7.0	4.0	3.0	1.0	1.0	No, images are still easier to get the gist of it and they are faster to solve as the visual apparatus functions faster then the reading one	:D	False	record			
	list_challenge	72.54	0.81		yes	no	8.0	8.0	5.0	4.0	1.0	I might prefer this one, but drag-and-drop is not convenient for me, clicking would be easier. Then what happens if our language profeciency is not good enough?	Good luck with the thesis and the study!	True	record
