	list_challenge	72.01	0.38		yes		8.0	8.0	7.0	2.0	4.0		The similar items were easy to rank, but among the ones with completely different sense, how one should rank those were much less trivial and obvious.	False	bar			
	list_challenge	158.94	1.0		yes	yes	10.0	9.0	9.0	2.0	3.0	I would prefer no captchas, but as it stands in regards to this challenge, Image-Captchas are preferred (which still have their own accessibility constraints).	Initially, it seems to give pereference to native speakers or high level speakers of English. This seems to ask someone more about their ability to understand vocabulary in context. Perhaps young speakers or English learners who encounter this type of captcha might be denied some kind of access. Otherwise, it was an interesting ordering game.	True	bar

	list_challenge	91.53	1.0		yes	yes	10.0	9.0	7.0	5.0	6.0	It would need to be *very* well-designed since this is a pretty subjective matter. I suppose you could set a task like 'find all the sentences where the meaning of word X is the same as in the example sentence'. That could work. I don't think a ranking exercise would work though.	I think this is a really nice idea - more interesting than finding all the photos with a car in them (well, more interesting for me as a linguist, at least). On the other hand, there are some obvious problems with creating a captcha challenge of this sort in that not everyone always agrees about distinctions between senses of words (lumpers vs. splitters) and this would discriminate against non-speakers of English (or would one be able to select one's own L1 for this? Maybe not all languages are as easy to create a challenge of this sort as English is). Good luck with the study	True	bar
