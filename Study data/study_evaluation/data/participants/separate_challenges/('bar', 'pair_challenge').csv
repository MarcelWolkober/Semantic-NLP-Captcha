	pair_challenge	24.85		1.0	yes	yes	10.0	10.0	9.0	4.0	2.0	No - the law 'bar' test example is fairly dependent on one's knowledge of the English language and/or law school technicalities. Meanwhile, the Image-Captcha - while tedious - is more accessible to users who speak different languages, as they can look up the prompt of an Image-Captcha in their mother language and identify the images accordingly (in retrospect, I realized that this is also technically true for a written Captcha challenge).	Honestly, I would include more questions in the challenge, perhaps even doubling the count to 10 (I think there were 5 prompts). As it is, the randomly generated pairwise examples gave me 4 comparisons where both 'bar' terms referred to a bar where you get drinks and only one comparison was comparing drastically different examples. With a larger pool of questions, this would allow for some more diverse comparisons for each participant.	True	bar			
	pair_challenge	70.74		0.69	yes	no	9.0	9.0	7.0	3.0	2.0	no, ordinary captcha are easier and less ambiguous		False	bar

	pair_challenge	109.47		1.0	yes	no	7.0	8.0	9.0	5.0	5.0	depending on how many sentences one has to evaluate, this approach could be preferable to image captchas, that can somnetimes be a bit unclear.	both examples should be full sentences, otherwise it can get confusing to parse the sentence-snippets.	True	bar			
	pair_challenge	58.42		1.0	yes	yes	10.0	10.0	10.0	9.0	3.0	It would depend on the number of questions. I'd prefer e.g. 3 pictures with bicycles to 3 sentences, but I'd prefer 3 sentences over 6 pictures with bicycles.		True	bar

	pair_challenge	83.74		0.25	yes	yes	9.0	9.0	9.0	9.0	5.0	No, it's more likely that a LLM would better understand this than an image caption.		False	bar

	pair_challenge	53.63		1.0	yes	no	8.0	9.0	9.0	5.0	2.0	This very much depends on the presentation and number of sentences required to solve this task: Parallel image processing is quite easy for humans. With text however, one needs to at least skim all of the sentences in order to make a (I imagine) quite noisy decision.		True	bar

	pair_challenge	84.7		0.82	yes	no	8.0	9.0	8.0	5.0	4.0	Yes, maybe. Sometimes the pictures used in Image-Captcha-challenges are very difficult to 'read'.		True	bar
