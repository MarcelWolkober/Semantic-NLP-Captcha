	pair_challenge	62.13		0.22	yes	no	9.0	9.0	7.0	3.0	1.0	I already have to solve many more captchas than I'd like -- but at least many of the image ones tend to be fairly quick to solve. Comparing words in several long-ish sentences seems like it would take even more time and energy.		False	part			
	pair_challenge	70.79		0.52			1.0	8.0	8.0	5.0	-1.0	no. it takes too long to read.		False	part			
	pair_challenge	137.47		0.55	yes	no	9.0	9.0	8.0	2.0	0.0	sure :)But yes, a little shorter would certainly be more agreeable.	I'm wondering if non-linguists would be a bit squeamish about the instructions to judge similarity in meaning. But maybe I underestimate non-linguists' eagerness to engage with semantics. I guess you'll find out!	False	part			
	pair_challenge	85.92		0.23	yes	yes	10.0	10.0	10.0	5.0	1.0	Captcha challenges that rely on images are difficult enough; it is often a problem. Substituting  sentence understanding would make it more difficult, especially for non-native speakers.	See above.	False	part

	pair_challenge	74.4		0.23			1.0	10.0	10.0	3.0	1.0	no	I don't think it an improvement over ordinary Capchas. And a test of English would be off-putting and unfair for loads of people word-wide	False	part			
	pair_challenge	180.94		0.33		no	9.0	9.0	7.0	5.0	2.0	I wasn't overly sure how to answer sometimes, so I think this challenge is too hard for a Captcha, which should be easy to solve without much linguistic knowledge required.		False	part			
	pair_challenge	233.78		0.33	yes	yes	10.0	7.0	8.0	6.0	2.0	This is preferable because it is at least not difficult to see the physical text.		False	part			
	pair_challenge	88.59		0.45	yes	yes	10.0	9.0	5.0	7.0	3.0	Yes, if the sentences took less time to read.	The sentences were pretty long which made it harder to read and make choices. 	False	part			
	pair_challenge	114.0		0.87			1.0	8.0	7.0	4.0	2.0	No, I would neither prefer nor dislike it		True	part
