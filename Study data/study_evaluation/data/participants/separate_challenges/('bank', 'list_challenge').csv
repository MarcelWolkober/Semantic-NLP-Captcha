	list_challenge	26.1	0.5		yes	no	9.0	10.0	10.0	5.0	0.0	image-captcha	How useful is your captcha, given a person with very low linguistic knowledge or bad english trying to access data, what if he gets some part of the order wrong, given that deciding the order is highly subjective.Very close meanings can be misinterpreted and will take multiple attempts for the user to just get to the single gold result unlike the image-captchas which will only require common-sense.

	list_challenge	181.22	1.0		no	no	5.0	7.0	4.0	3.0	5.0	No, because I think it's rather difficult because there is always room for interpretation with sentences		True	bank			
	list_challenge	48.75	0.5		yes	yes	10.0	8.0	8.0	2.0	3.0	I would prefer the image-based one to this as this takes more time and requires more thought.	Some rankings seem subjective to me so I'm not sure there is just one possible answer; one sentence was rather unclear to me the way it was worded. 	False	bank

	list_challenge	66.81	1.0		yes	no	8.0	10.0	8.0	7.0	5.0	It seems a bit slower to perform than a typical captcha (text or puzzle), but quicker than an image-captcha.		True	bank
