	pair_challenge	75.11		-0.35	yes	no	9.0	9.0	9.0	1.0	3.0	The sentences were quite difficult to understand, I am not sure they were the best examples for this task. However, I think it could be useful in the future with more suitable examples.	The first screen was a bit too crowded and full of typos. As a senior in the field, I'd advise you proofread everything :)	False	record			
	pair_challenge	183.85		-0.73	no	no	8.0	3.0	2.0	1.0	0.0	no	lot of reading bad ... want more pictures	False	record			
	pair_challenge	104.77		0.66	yes	no	9.0	8.0	9.0	5.0	4.0	rather not, because in comparison to Image-Captcha it takes more effort and time.		False	record			
	pair_challenge	74.2		0.4	yes	no	8.0	9.0	7.0	5.0	3.0	Probably not. The similarity scale is not particularly well defined, so what is a 2 for one person might be a 3 for another even if they understand the sentences the same way. It might work if the response time and cursor movement are taken into account, though.		False	record

	pair_challenge	76.65		0.18	yes	no	8.0	9.0	9.0	2.0	1.0	No	It excludes too many people - those who do not speak the language good enough.	False	record

	pair_challenge	53.73		-0.11	yes	yes	10.0	9.0	9.0	8.0	6.0	Only if this study revealed inter-rater agreement that was EXTREMELY high.  Otherwise, this is probably too subjective for such a use and would result in frustrated users not being able to buy Taylor Swift tickets and the like.	Very interesting study; best of luck to you!	False	record			
	pair_challenge	109.62		0.63	yes	yes	10.0	7.0	8.0	10.0	3.0	I like this challenge but it is very subjective whereas Image-Captcha feels more objective.	"The sentence that contains ""on records"" is challenging to read as a native speaker because it is so close to the standard phrase ""on record"" but isn't. This particular sentence seems like a hard base sentence to rank against because it is so easily open to misinterpretation and feels annoying to read."	False	record			
	pair_challenge	225.8		-0.83	yes	no	7.0	5.0	3.0	7.0	2.0	I would prefer Image-Captcha because images in general are more straightforward than texts.		False	record

	pair_challenge	52.46		-0.57			1.0	8.0	7.0	6.0	3.0	as a language lover, I wouldn't mind this sort of challenge, but image-captcha is likely much quicker to solve, and more accessible to users who are not English C2 speakers		False	record

	pair_challenge	73.25		0.4	yes	no	8.0	8.0	8.0	9.0	1.0	No, it can be ableist under certain contexts and disadvantage speakers of dialects	N/A, very interesting	False	record			
	pair_challenge	174.59		0.75	yes	no	8.0	7.0	6.0	5.0	2.0	no, I prefer the Image-Captcha		False	record			
	pair_challenge	70.83		-0.35	yes	no	9.0	7.0	10.0	5.0	2.0	It's better than the counting challenges with a timer, for sure, but would be challenging for non-native speakers or people with some cognitive disability.	I don't know if this was on purpose, but while almost all the sentences were easy to understand, the one about poetry sales records being tuned was very confusing.	False	record
