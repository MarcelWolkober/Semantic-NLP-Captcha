	list_challenge	204.54	0.74		yes	no	7.0	9.0	3.0	3.0	1.0	It depends on the language. If the semantic captcha is not in my native language, I would prefer the image captcha. If the sentence is in my native language, I would have no preference (maybe the time it takes me to solve the corresponding captcha).	It wasn't really possible to order the sentences that didn't have a similar meaning (I'm not sure if this was intentional).	False	part

	list_challenge	150.85	0.03		yes	no	7.0	3.0	4.0	8.0	3.0	No, because I could understand image captchas and solve them much faster than the proposed Semantic NLP catches. Because we humans see faster than we read. Compared to the typical scenarios in image captchas, which are rather trivial, like spotting the traffic light, I found the topic here quite abstract, making ordering difficult. Maybe only selecting matching sentences so the given reference sentence.		False	part

People have a notoriously high level of disagreement re: relatedness of word senses. The example I had was especially challenging, as some instances used ""part"" as part of a verb (""take part"") and others used it as a more typical noun."	I'm a computational linguist.
