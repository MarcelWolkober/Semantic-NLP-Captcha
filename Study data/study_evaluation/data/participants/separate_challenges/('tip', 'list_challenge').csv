	list_challenge	53.05	0.94		yes	yes	10.0	7.0	7.0	5.0	0.0	It took me longer than any other Captcha I have performed, so I would prefer different kinds.	This took me a long time because the sentences were long and some of the grammar was antiquated and hard to understand (as a native English speaker from America). I don't know if all of the examples were like that but I would not like to do this kind of thing as a Captcha.	True	tip
