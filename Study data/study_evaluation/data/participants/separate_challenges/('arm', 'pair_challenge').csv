	pair_challenge	115.55		0.85	yes	no	8.0	10.0	9.0	5.0	2.0	Not quite. In this semantic challenge it can be very easy to fail it by mistake (one wrong click?)	Selection of focal words for the challenge might be problematic. 1. Some speakers may be unfamiliar with some words or some senses. 2. How many words have enough senses and shades of meaning to be useful?   	True	arm

	pair_challenge	43.43		0.75			10.0	9.0	9.0	8.0	1.0	no	While I don't think Image-Captcha is good either, this feels overly limiting because it relies on native-like levels of language proficiency. The type that I like the most is the slide the puzzle piece into place in an image one. This is far more intuitive and more generally applicable than the visual acuity required for Image-Captcha or language proficiency required for sentence meaning challenges like this.	False	arm

	pair_challenge	77.64		0.38	yes	yes	10.0	10.0	8.0	4.0	2.0	No. It's easier to spot objects than to decide between literal and figurative language and is obviously much easier for non-native speakers.		False	arm			
	pair_challenge	75.68		0.74	yes	no	7.0	8.0	9.0	8.0	3.0	Depends on the difficulty. The sentences in this survey were easy to label, however, if they are more complicated and require re-reading multiple times, then I'd rather use an image captcha		False	arm
