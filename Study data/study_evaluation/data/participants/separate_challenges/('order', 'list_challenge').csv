It would be cool if this made everyone think about it more though. What can people do linguistically without a second thought that thousands upon thousands of vector spaces cannot do?	True	order

"I feel like it could work with if: 1. the instructions were refined to be more intuitive. E.g. ""Click on all traffic lights"" is much quicker to grasp than ""re-rank the sentences based on semantic similarity of the highlighted word"" (paraphrasing here, but I think you get what I mean :) )2. Maybe multiple pair-wise comparisons would be more intuitive (e.g. in which one of these two sentences the highlighted word is closer to the reference). Not sure if that would have the same robustness though.3. Bit of a side-note, but have you tried giving this task to an LLM? Would be curios to know how it compares "	True	order
