Meanwhile, the Image-Captcha - while tedious - is more accessible to users who speak different languages, as they can look up the prompt of an Image-Captcha in their mother language and identify the images accordingly (in retrospect, I realized that this is also technically true for a written Captcha challenge).	Honestly, I would include more questions in the challenge, perhaps even doubling the count to 10 (I think there were 5 prompts). As it is, the randomly generated pairwise examples gave me 4 comparisons where both 'bar' terms referred to a bar where you get drinks and only one comparison was comparing drastically different examples. With a larger pool of questions, this would allow for some more diverse comparisons for each participant.	True	bar

I think the idea is fun, but the idea of testing if one's a human by testing one's semantic understanding in English is something I find quite problematic. It assumes that every user would be proficient enough to answer the test seeing as it requires near-native proficiency to understand the examples, which is not the case for a lot of people, and particularly disparaging towards non-native speakers coming from a minority background. It is also implied that there is (only) one correct answer to this test, which is never really the case when it comes to  semantics, as people might have different conceptualisations of meaning based on their previous knowledge and how knowledge is mapped and linked in the brain.

On the other hand, there are some obvious problems with creating a captcha challenge of this sort in that not everyone always agrees about distinctions between senses of words (lumpers vs. splitters) and this would discriminate against non-speakers of English (or would one be able to select one's own L1 for this?

	pair_challenge	179.85		0.7	yes	no	9.0	3.0	4.0	6.0	4.0	Not sure.	I didn’t understand the first two sentences, so my rating was basically a random guess. If implemented, it should make sure that a proficient speaker understands the sentences. Also, I found it annoying that the same 2nd sentence was repeated every time. 	False	tip			
	pair_challenge	53.63		1.0	yes	no	8.0	9.0	9.0	5.0	2.0	This very much depends on the presentation and number of sentences required to solve this task: Parallel image processing is quite easy for humans. With text however, one needs to at least skim all of the sentences in order to make a (I imagine) quite noisy decision.		True	bar

It would be nice if people could choose what kind of Captcha they prefer, to avoid accessibility issues.	True	arm

	pair_challenge	70.83		-0.35	yes	no	9.0	7.0	10.0	5.0	2.0	It's better than the counting challenges with a timer, for sure, but would be challenging for non-native speakers or people with some cognitive disability.	I don't know if this was on purpose, but while almost all the sentences were easy to understand, the one about poetry sales records being tuned was very confusing.	False	record

	pair_challenge	88.13		-0.16	yes	no	8.0	8.0	9.0	6.0	3.0	No, because it require more knowledge in the language of interest. But it might be a good alternative for visually-disabled people (using screen readers).	Maybe I have overread it, but maybe emphasize in the instructions more that you are interested in the meaning of the words in bold-face and not the sentences in general. My ratings refer to a meaning comparison of the wohle sentence. I just understood to rate the bold-face words when I saw the question on the general information page.	False	bank
