	pair_challenge	52.46		-0.57			1.0	8.0	7.0	6.0	3.0	as a language lover, I wouldn't mind this sort of challenge, but image-captcha is likely much quicker to solve, and more accessible to users who are not English C2 speakers		False	record			
	pair_challenge	179.85		0.7	yes	no	9.0	3.0	4.0	6.0	4.0	Not sure.	I didnâ€™t understand the first two sentences, so my rating was basically a random guess. If implemented, it should make sure that a proficient speaker understands the sentences. Also, I found it annoying that the same 2nd sentence was repeated every time. 	False	tip			
	pair_challenge	88.13		-0.16	yes	no	8.0	8.0	9.0	6.0	3.0	No, because it require more knowledge in the language of interest. But it might be a good alternative for visually-disabled people (using screen readers).	Maybe I have overread it, but maybe emphasize in the instructions more that you are interested in the meaning of the words in bold-face and not the sentences in general. My ratings refer to a meaning comparison of the wohle sentence. I just understood to rate the bold-face words when I saw the question on the general information page.	False	bank
