	list_challenge	183.22	-0.48		yes	no	8.0	9.0	8.0	3.0	1.0	No	The challenge is very time consuming compared to an image-captcha. Some users could be annoyed by that	False	twist

	list_challenge	204.54	0.74		yes	no	7.0	9.0	3.0	3.0	1.0	It depends on the language. If the semantic captcha is not in my native language, I would prefer the image captcha. If the sentence is in my native language, I would have no preference (maybe the time it takes me to solve the corresponding captcha).	It wasn't really possible to order the sentences that didn't have a similar meaning (I'm not sure if this was intentional).	False	part			
	list_challenge	93.27	1.0		yes	no	5.0	10.0	9.0	3.0	5.0	No	The manual ordering interface is annoying. Please consider developing alternative input methods	True	arm			
	list_challenge	181.22	1.0		no	no	5.0	7.0	4.0	3.0	5.0	No, because I think it's rather difficult because there is always room for interpretation with sentences		True	bank

	list_challenge	101.05	0.29		yes	no	9.0	7.0	3.0	3.0	5.0	Definitely not.	With 1-2 items, the context seemed very restricted (maybe too restricted to even judge the exact meaning of that instance). I would have liked to get more information on what exactly you were looking for in terms of similarity, assuming there's one ideal solution. Is 'record' inside a compound like 'record label' the same as a specific record, or less similar to playing a record than a specific record (if so, on what grounds)?	False	record			
	list_challenge	62.27	1.0		yes	yes	10.0	5.0	4.0	3.0	1.0	No. I don't want to do that everytime I have to solve a captcha	Yeah, I don't know if this matters, but the number boxes can go above ten	True	bank

	list_challenge	48.83	1.0		yes	yes	10.0	9.0	8.0	3.0	2.0	I think I would prefer an image Captcha, inasmuch as image Captchas are usually a little quicker to solve.	"One part of the example provided which might underscore a fundamental weakness of the concept is the two sentences involving an arm of the sea: it's hard to see why speakers would rate one use of ""arm"" in the phrase ""arm of the sea"" as semantically closer to a literal, anatomical arm than the other, especially when there's nothing in the context which distinguishes these two arms of the sea from one another clearly (such as size, hypothetically, or a poetic attribution of animacy to the sea).

	list_challenge	71.06	0.23		yes	yes	10.0	8.0	6.0	3.0	3.0	It's a nice change of pace, but I feel like it would be very easy to solve with an LLM â€“ and if it's not currently, if it catches on, then someone will research until they can break it.		False	twist
