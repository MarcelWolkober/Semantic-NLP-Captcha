	list_challenge	72.34	0.76		yes	no	8.0	8.0	7.0	8.0	3.0	No, as it takes significantly longer to solve and might be a problem for websites in languages I don't or barely speak (but otherwise could easily use using some translate feature)	The meaning of the words was very similar in some sentences making it redundant. I feel like I could easily attack a system like this with creating a small statistical model on a huge corpus of data.	False	arm

	list_challenge	104.56	0.23		yes	yes	10.0	8.0	8.0	8.0	3.0	No, Image Captcha is much quicker and easier to process than sentence ranking. Especially ranking such long sentences and so many of them.	I believe the example sentence had a few grammatical errors. It was difficult to process the meaning of the sentence, which made the task more difficult.	False	twist

	list_challenge	150.85	0.03		yes	no	7.0	3.0	4.0	8.0	3.0	No, because I could understand image captchas and solve them much faster than the proposed Semantic NLP catches. Because we humans see faster than we read. Compared to the typical scenarios in image captchas, which are rather trivial, like spotting the traffic light, I found the topic here quite abstract, making ordering difficult. Maybe only selecting matching sentences so the given reference sentence.		False	part			
	list_challenge	68.34	1.0		yes	yes	10.0	9.0	8.0	8.0	2.0	As a user I would be interested in a fast method. Captcha with images is sometimes slow.		True	arm
