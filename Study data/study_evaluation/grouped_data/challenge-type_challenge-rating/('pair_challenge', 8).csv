	pair_challenge	59.73		0.48	yes	no	7.0	9.0	6.0	8.0	3.0	Probably	May be it is more convenient to classify if two sentences have the same meaning or not 	False	bank

	pair_challenge	43.43		0.75			10.0	9.0	9.0	8.0	1.0	no	While I don't think Image-Captcha is good either, this feels overly limiting because it relies on native-like levels of language proficiency. The type that I like the most is the slide the puzzle piece into place in an image one. This is far more intuitive and more generally applicable than the visual acuity required for Image-Captcha or language proficiency required for sentence meaning challenges like this.	False	arm

	pair_challenge	214.55		0.57	yes	no	8.0	9.0	5.0	8.0	2.0	No (it may be more time consuming and may be difficult for many people)		False	arm			
	pair_challenge	53.73		-0.11	yes	yes	10.0	9.0	9.0	8.0	6.0	Only if this study revealed inter-rater agreement that was EXTREMELY high.  Otherwise, this is probably too subjective for such a use and would result in frustrated users not being able to buy Taylor Swift tickets and the like.	Very interesting study; best of luck to you!

	pair_challenge	75.68		0.74	yes	no	7.0	8.0	9.0	8.0	3.0	Depends on the difficulty. The sentences in this survey were easy to label, however, if they are more complicated and require re-reading multiple times, then I'd rather use an image captcha		False	arm

	pair_challenge	48.99		0.59	yes	yes	9.0	10.0	8.0	8.0	15.0	no, because image captcha is still more clear imo	none, its a great idea, i just think people will give very different scores	False	order
