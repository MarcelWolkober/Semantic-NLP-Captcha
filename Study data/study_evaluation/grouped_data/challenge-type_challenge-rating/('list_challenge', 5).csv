This one is arguably harder for the human (and perhaps not even for the machine). The other ""issue"" is that in the example I had (""record"") there were clearly two different senses (thing to put music on; thing to keep track of other things) and ranking them doesn't really really make sense -- it's more of a ""put it in the correct box"" type of deal"	True	record

This took me a long time because the sentences were long and some of the grammar was antiquated and hard to understand (as a native English speaker from America). I don't know if all of the examples were like that but I would not like to do this kind of thing as a Captcha.	True	tip

	list_challenge	91.53	1.0		yes	yes	10.0	9.0	7.0	5.0	6.0	It would need to be *very* well-designed since this is a pretty subjective matter. I suppose you could set a task like 'find all the sentences where the meaning of word X is the same as in the example sentence'. That could work. I don't think a ranking exercise would work though.	I think this is a really nice idea - more interesting than finding all the photos with a car in them (well, more interesting for me as a linguist, at least). On the other hand, there are some obvious problems with creating a captcha challenge of this sort in that not everyone always agrees about distinctions between senses of words (lumpers vs. splitters) and this would discriminate against non-speakers of English (or would one be able to select one's own L1 for this? Maybe not all languages are as easy to create a challenge of this sort as English is). Good luck with the study	True	bar
