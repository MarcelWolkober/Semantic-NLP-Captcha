	pair_challenge	115.55		0.85	yes	no	8.0	10.0	9.0	5.0	2.0	Not quite. In this semantic challenge it can be very easy to fail it by mistake (one wrong click?)	Selection of focal words for the challenge might be problematic. 1. Some speakers may be unfamiliar with some words or some senses. 2. How many words have enough senses and shades of meaning to be useful?   	True	arm

	pair_challenge	85.92		0.23	yes	yes	10.0	10.0	10.0	5.0	1.0	Captcha challenges that rely on images are difficult enough; it is often a problem. Substituting  sentence understanding would make it more difficult, especially for non-native speakers.	See above.	False	part

	pair_challenge	74.2		0.4	yes	no	8.0	9.0	7.0	5.0	3.0	Probably not. The similarity scale is not particularly well defined, so what is a 2 for one person might be a 3 for another even if they understand the sentences the same way. It might work if the response time and cursor movement are taken into account, though.		False	record

	pair_challenge	53.63		1.0	yes	no	8.0	9.0	9.0	5.0	2.0	This very much depends on the presentation and number of sentences required to solve this task: Parallel image processing is quite easy for humans. With text however, one needs to at least skim all of the sentences in order to make a (I imagine) quite noisy decision.		True	bar			
	pair_challenge	70.83		-0.35	yes	no	9.0	7.0	10.0	5.0	2.0	It's better than the counting challenges with a timer, for sure, but would be challenging for non-native speakers or people with some cognitive disability.	I don't know if this was on purpose, but while almost all the sentences were easy to understand, the one about poetry sales records being tuned was very confusing.	False	record
