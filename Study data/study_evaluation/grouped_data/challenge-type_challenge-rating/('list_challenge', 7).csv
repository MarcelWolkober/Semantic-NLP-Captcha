	list_challenge	52.38	1.0		yes	no	8.0	9.0	9.0	7.0	5.0	No, image is more convenient for me as you can easily spot patterns / objects and there is no need to read through sentences. Also images are more language-independent.	A short introduction on what a Captcha-challenge is would have been nice. But apart from this the study was great!	True	arm
