	pair_challenge	62.13		0.22	yes	no	9.0	9.0	7.0	3.0	1.0	I already have to solve many more captchas than I'd like -- but at least many of the image ones tend to be fairly quick to solve. Comparing words in several long-ish sentences seems like it would take even more time and energy.		False	part

	pair_challenge	429.11		0.8	yes	no	6.0	7.0	6.0	3.0	2.0	For me it's okay, but in general not because you need good knowledge in the language to complete the captcha.		True	tip

	pair_challenge	83.09		0.83	yes	no	9.0	10.0	8.0	3.0	3.0	This is probably more demanding than captcha, probably also fuzzier as much as I can imagine how it works.
