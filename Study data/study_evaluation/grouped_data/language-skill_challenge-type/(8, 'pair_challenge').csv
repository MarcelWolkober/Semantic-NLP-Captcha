Selection of focal words for the challenge might be problematic. 1. Some speakers may be unfamiliar with some words or some senses. 2. How many words have enough senses and shades of meaning to be useful?   	True	arm

	pair_challenge	74.2		0.4	yes	no	8.0	9.0	7.0	5.0	3.0	Probably not. The similarity scale is not particularly well defined, so what is a 2 for one person might be a 3 for another even if they understand the sentences the same way.

	pair_challenge	53.63		1.0	yes	no	8.0	9.0	9.0	5.0	2.0	This very much depends on the presentation and number of sentences required to solve this task: Parallel image processing is quite easy for humans.

	pair_challenge	88.13		-0.16	yes	no	8.0	8.0	9.0	6.0	3.0	No, because it require more knowledge in the language of interest. But it might be a good alternative for visually-disabled people (using screen readers).	Maybe I have overread it, but maybe emphasize in the instructions more that you are interested in the meaning of the words in bold-face and not the sentences in general. My ratings refer to a meaning comparison of the wohle sentence. I just understood to rate the bold-face words when I saw the question on the general information page.	False	bank
