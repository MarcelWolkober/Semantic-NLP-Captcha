	pair_challenge	85.92		0.23	yes	yes	10.0	10.0	10.0	5.0	1.0	Captcha challenges that rely on images are difficult enough; it is often a problem. Substituting  sentence understanding would make it more difficult, especially for non-native speakers.	See above.	False	part			
	pair_challenge	24.85		1.0	yes	yes	10.0	10.0	9.0	4.0	2.0	No - the law 'bar' test example is fairly dependent on one's knowledge of the English language and/or law school technicalities. Meanwhile, the Image-Captcha - while tedious - is more accessible to users who speak different languages, as they can look up the prompt of an Image-Captcha in their mother language and identify the images accordingly (in retrospect, I realized that this is also technically true for a written Captcha challenge).	Honestly, I would include more questions in the challenge, perhaps even doubling the count to 10 (I think there were 5 prompts). As it is, the randomly generated pairwise examples gave me 4 comparisons where both 'bar' terms referred to a bar where you get drinks and only one comparison was comparing drastically different examples. With a larger pool of questions, this would allow for some more diverse comparisons for each participant.	True	bar

	pair_challenge	43.43		0.75			10.0	9.0	9.0	8.0	1.0	no	While I don't think Image-Captcha is good either, this feels overly limiting because it relies on native-like levels of language proficiency. The type that I like the most is the slide the puzzle piece into place in an image one. This is far more intuitive and more generally applicable than the visual acuity required for Image-Captcha or language proficiency required for sentence meaning challenges like this.	False	arm

	pair_challenge	40.89		0.75	yes	yes	10.0	10.0	7.0	3.0	2.0	It is interesting but I don't think I would prefer it, not that I am a fan of Captchas.	Would these not be easy for a robot to solve?	False	order

	pair_challenge	58.42		1.0	yes	yes	10.0	10.0	10.0	9.0	3.0	It would depend on the number of questions. I'd prefer e.g. 3 pictures with bicycles to 3 sentences, but I'd prefer 3 sentences over 6 pictures with bicycles.		True	bar			
	pair_challenge	95.58		0.29	yes	yes	10.0	8.0	7.0	5.0	3.0	Probably better than Image Captcha but I can imagine that it might prove tiresome if one had to do it too often (like Image-Captcha also is)		False	twist

	pair_challenge	109.62		0.63	yes	yes	10.0	7.0	8.0	10.0	3.0	I like this challenge but it is very subjective whereas Image-Captcha feels more objective.	"The sentence that contains ""on records"" is challenging to read as a native speaker because it is so close to the standard phrase ""on record"" but isn't. This particular sentence seems like a hard base sentence to rank against because it is so easily open to misinterpretation and feels annoying to read."	False	record			
	pair_challenge	233.78		0.33	yes	yes	10.0	7.0	8.0	6.0	2.0	This is preferable because it is at least not difficult to see the physical text.		False	part			
	pair_challenge	77.64		0.38	yes	yes	10.0	10.0	8.0	4.0	2.0	No. It's easier to spot objects than to decide between literal and figurative language and is obviously much easier for non-native speakers.		False	arm			
	pair_challenge	88.59		0.45	yes	yes	10.0	9.0	5.0	7.0	3.0	Yes, if the sentences took less time to read.	The sentences were pretty long which made it harder to read and make choices. 	False	part
