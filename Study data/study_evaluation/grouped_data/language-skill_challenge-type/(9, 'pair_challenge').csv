	pair_challenge	137.47		0.55	yes	no	9.0	9.0	8.0	2.0	0.0	sure :)But yes, a little shorter would certainly be more agreeable.	I'm wondering if non-linguists would be a bit squeamish about the instructions to judge similarity in meaning. But maybe I underestimate non-linguists' eagerness to engage with semantics. I guess you'll find out!	False	part

	pair_challenge	75.11		-0.35	yes	no	9.0	9.0	9.0	1.0	3.0	The sentences were quite difficult to understand, I am not sure they were the best examples for this task. However, I think it could be useful in the future with more suitable examples.	The first screen was a bit too crowded and full of typos. As a senior in the field, I'd advise you proofread everything :)	False	record

	pair_challenge	104.77		0.66	yes	no	9.0	8.0	9.0	5.0	4.0	rather not, because in comparison to Image-Captcha it takes more effort and time.		False	record

	pair_challenge	180.94		0.33		no	9.0	9.0	7.0	5.0	2.0	I wasn't overly sure how to answer sometimes, so I think this challenge is too hard for a Captcha, which should be easy to solve without much linguistic knowledge required.		False	part			
	pair_challenge	83.09		0.83	yes	no	9.0	10.0	8.0	3.0	3.0	This is probably more demanding than captcha, probably also fuzzier as much as I can imagine how it works.	"The survey would be much more trustworthy if there was some more specific information as to who and why conducts it.""How convenient and practical do you think is such type of ""human-detection"" challenge in daily life?"" contains two questions, as convenient and practical have different (even if related) meanings"	True	order

If implemented, it should make sure that a proficient speaker understands the sentences. Also, I found it annoying that the same 2nd sentence was repeated every time. 	False	tip			
	pair_challenge	48.99		0.59	yes	yes	9.0	10.0	8.0	8.0	15.0	no, because image captcha is still more clear imo	none, its a great idea, i just think people will give very different scores	False	order			
	pair_challenge	70.83		-0.35	yes	no	9.0	7.0	10.0	5.0	2.0	It's better than the counting challenges with a timer, for sure, but would be challenging for non-native speakers or people with some cognitive disability.	I don't know if this was on purpose, but while almost all the sentences were easy to understand, the one about poetry sales records being tuned was very confusing.	False	record
