	list_challenge	72.34	0.76		yes	no	8.0	8.0	7.0	8.0	3.0	No, as it takes significantly longer to solve and might be a problem for websites in languages I don't or barely speak (but otherwise could easily use using some translate feature)	The meaning of the words was very similar in some sentences making it redundant. I feel like I could easily attack a system like this with creating a small statistical model on a huge corpus of data.	False	arm

	list_challenge	310.83	0.23		yes	no	8.0	8.0	5.0	4.0	4.0	Not sure, I would be unsure if it's the correct solution with so many items. For me it's fun but you have to think more than with a regular captcha. I would have put the convenience for myself higher but because it's not as accessible for non-English speakers etc. I lowered the score.	Maybe give a correct ordering as an example to illustrate the idea of semantic similarity	False	twist			
	list_challenge	86.44	1.0		yes	no	8.0	8.0	6.0	4.0	3.0	No, because Image-Captcha is much quicker to fulfill and semantic similarity depends highly on language proficiency and is very subjective	What to do with sentences that I would rate on the same level?	True	arm			
	list_challenge	183.22	-0.48		yes	no	8.0	9.0	8.0	3.0	1.0	No	The challenge is very time consuming compared to an image-captcha. Some users could be annoyed by that	False	twist

	list_challenge	66.81	1.0		yes	no	8.0	10.0	8.0	7.0	5.0	It seems a bit slower to perform than a typical captcha (text or puzzle), but quicker than an image-captcha.		True	bank

	list_challenge	122.69	0.23		yes	no	8.0	8.0	4.0	6.0	4.0	I am not sure if I would prefer the textual captcha, because it has too much ambiguity and requires more thinking.		False	twist			
	list_challenge	73.87	1.0		yes	no	8.0	8.0	5.0	2.0	3.0	No, this felt like a lot more effort than an image captcha, which feels a lot more intuitive.	"I feel like it could work with if: 1. the instructions were refined to be more intuitive. E.g. ""Click on all traffic lights"" is much quicker to grasp than ""re-rank the sentences based on semantic similarity of the highlighted word"" (paraphrasing here, but I think you get what I mean :) )2. Maybe multiple pair-wise comparisons would be more intuitive (e.g. in which one of these two sentences the highlighted word is closer to the reference). Not sure if that would have the same robustness though.3. Bit of a side-note, but have you tried giving this task to an LLM? Would be curios to know how it compares "	True	order

It would be nice if people could choose what kind of Captcha they prefer, to avoid accessibility issues.	True	arm			
	list_challenge	30.95	1.0		yes	no	8.0	9.0	7.0	5.0	8.0	I'd like it because it's something else for a change. But I'm rather steeped in linguistics, might be hard to understand for people who are not.		True	bank			
	list_challenge	105.1	-0.61		yes	no	8.0	5.0	3.0	4.0	5.0	Probably not. I found the captcha challenged quite difficult. You need quite a fundamental understanding of the English language to know all semantic nuances of a word regarding it's context	Quite an interesting approach. However, it might not feasible to use as not every user is so fluid in the English language	False	twist			
	list_challenge	52.38	1.0		yes	no	8.0	9.0	9.0	7.0	5.0	No, image is more convenient for me as you can easily spot patterns / objects and there is no need to read through sentences. Also images are more language-independent.	A short introduction on what a Captcha-challenge is would have been nice. But apart from this the study was great!	True	arm
