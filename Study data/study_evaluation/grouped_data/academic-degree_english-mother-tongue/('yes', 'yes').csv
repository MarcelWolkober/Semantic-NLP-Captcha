	list_challenge	104.56	0.23		yes	yes	10.0	8.0	8.0	8.0	3.0	No, Image Captcha is much quicker and easier to process than sentence ranking. Especially ranking such long sentences and so many of them.	I believe the example sentence had a few grammatical errors. It was difficult to process the meaning of the sentence, which made the task more difficult.	False	twist

	pair_challenge	24.85		1.0	yes	yes	10.0	10.0	9.0	4.0	2.0	No - the law 'bar' test example is fairly dependent on one's knowledge of the English language and/or law school technicalities. Meanwhile, the Image-Captcha - while tedious - is more accessible to users who speak different languages, as they can look up the prompt of an Image-Captcha in their mother language and identify the images accordingly (in retrospect, I realized that this is also technically true for a written Captcha challenge).	Honestly, I would include more questions in the challenge, perhaps even doubling the count to 10 (I think there were 5 prompts). As it is, the randomly generated pairwise examples gave me 4 comparisons where both 'bar' terms referred to a bar where you get drinks and only one comparison was comparing drastically different examples. With a larger pool of questions, this would allow for some more diverse comparisons for each participant.	True	bar

	list_challenge	53.05	0.94		yes	yes	10.0	7.0	7.0	5.0	0.0	It took me longer than any other Captcha I have performed, so I would prefer different kinds.	This took me a long time because the sentences were long and some of the grammar was antiquated and hard to understand (as a native English speaker from America). I don't know if all of the examples were like that but I would not like to do this kind of thing as a Captcha.	True	tip

	list_challenge	158.94	1.0		yes	yes	10.0	9.0	9.0	2.0	3.0	I would prefer no captchas, but as it stands in regards to this challenge, Image-Captchas are preferred (which still have their own accessibility constraints).	Initially, it seems to give pereference to native speakers or high level speakers of English. This seems to ask someone more about their ability to understand vocabulary in context. Perhaps young speakers or English learners who encounter this type of captcha might be denied some kind of access. Otherwise, it was an interesting ordering game.	True	bar			
	list_challenge	48.75	0.5		yes	yes	10.0	8.0	8.0	2.0	3.0	I would prefer the image-based one to this as this takes more time and requires more thought.

	pair_challenge	95.58		0.29	yes	yes	10.0	8.0	7.0	5.0	3.0	Probably better than Image Captcha but I can imagine that it might prove tiresome if one had to do it too often (like Image-Captcha also is)		False	twist

	list_challenge	91.53	1.0		yes	yes	10.0	9.0	7.0	5.0	6.0	It would need to be *very* well-designed since this is a pretty subjective matter. I suppose you could set a task like 'find all the sentences where the meaning of word X is the same as in the example sentence'. That could work. I don't think a ranking exercise would work though.	I think this is a really nice idea - more interesting than finding all the photos with a car in them (well, more interesting for me as a linguist, at least). On the other hand, there are some obvious problems with creating a captcha challenge of this sort in that not everyone always agrees about distinctions between senses of words (lumpers vs. splitters) and this would discriminate against non-speakers of English (or would one be able to select one's own L1 for this? Maybe not all languages are as easy to create a challenge of this sort as English is). Good luck with the study	True	bar			
	list_challenge	67.9	0.23		yes	yes	10.0	6.0	3.0	2.0	3.0	Not really, too exhausting	This takes a LOT of brainpower. If it proves effective, might be good for something you REALLY want to keep bots out of, but it'd be exhausting to do this on a regular basis. It might be better with fewer options, but if you take it down to three then there's a 17% chance to get through by luck, so you're limited there too. Also it's extremely subjective, so the idea of having only one right answer seems absurd to me, and would probably lock out a lot of less-literate humans as well.	False	twist

	pair_challenge	109.62		0.63	yes	yes	10.0	7.0	8.0	10.0	3.0	I like this challenge but it is very subjective whereas Image-Captcha feels more objective.	"The sentence that contains ""on records"" is challenging to read as a native speaker because it is so close to the standard phrase ""on record"" but isn't.

"One part of the example provided which might underscore a fundamental weakness of the concept is the two sentences involving an arm of the sea: it's hard to see why speakers would rate one use of ""arm"" in the phrase ""arm of the sea"" as semantically closer to a literal, anatomical arm than the other, especially when there's nothing in the context which distinguishes these two arms of the sea from one another clearly (such as size, hypothetically, or a poetic attribution of animacy to the sea).
