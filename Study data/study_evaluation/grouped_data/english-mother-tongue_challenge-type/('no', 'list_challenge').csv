I think the idea is fun, but the idea of testing if one's a human by testing one's semantic understanding in English is something I find quite problematic. It assumes that every user would be proficient enough to answer the test seeing as it requires near-native proficiency to understand the examples, which is not the case for a lot of people, and particularly disparaging towards non-native speakers coming from a minority background. It is also implied that there is (only) one correct answer to this test, which is never really the case when it comes to  semantics, as people might have different conceptualisations of meaning based on their previous knowledge and how knowledge is mapped and linked in the brain. It might be good to read up on cognitive linguistics/semantics for this study.	True	record
